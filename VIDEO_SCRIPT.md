### **[SCENE 2: LIVE CODING SESSION 1 - VUE.JS FUNDAMENTALS - 1:00-3:00]**

**[SCREEN: Create new HTML file, start typing basic Vue.js structure]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Let's start with Vue.js fundamentals. First, I'll create our basic HTML structure. Notice how we include Vue.js via CDN for simplicity - perfect for learning and prototyping."

**[SCREEN: Type out basic HTML structure with Vue CDN]**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PsychHealth Tutorial</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        <!-- Our Vue app will go here -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "Now, let's create our first Vue.js component. This is where the magic happens - we'll create reactive data that automatically updates the interface when it changes."

**[SCREEN: Add JavaScript section and start typing Vue app]**

```javascript
const { createApp } = Vue;

createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            appTitle: 'PsychHealth Platform',
            currentUser: null,
            isAuthenticated: false,
            posts: []
        }
    }
}).mount('#app');
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "See how Vue.js uses the data function to define reactive state? This is fundamentally different from traditional JavaScript - when these values change, the interface automatically updates. Let me demonstrate this live."

**[SCREEN: Add template with data binding and show live updates in browser]**

```html
<div id="app">
    <h1>{{ appTitle }}</h1>
    <p v-if="isAuthenticated">Welcome back!</p>
    <p v-else>Please log in to continue</p>
    <button @click="isAuthenticated = !isAuthenticated">
        {{ isAuthenticated ? 'Logout' : 'Login' }}
    </button>
</div>
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "Watch this - when I click the button, the interface automatically responds to state changes. This reactive binding is the foundation of modern interface development. No manual DOM manipulation required!"

**[SCREEN: Click button multiple times, show reactive updates]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "This might seem simple, but it's revolutionary. In traditional JavaScript, you'd need to manually update text content, show/hide elements, and manage state. Vue.js handles all of this automatically through reactive programming."

### **[SCENE 3: LIVE CODING SESSION 2 - INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS - 3:00-5:00]**

**[SCREEN: Expand the Vue app to add mental health assessment functionality]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Now let's build something more complex - an interactive mental health assessment. This will demonstrate component thinking and how to handle user interactions professionally."

**[SCREEN: Add assessment data structure]**

```javascript
data() {
    return {
        // Previous data...
        currentView: 'home',
        assessmentQuestions: [
            {
                id: 1,
                question: "How often have you felt nervous or anxious?",
                options: ["Not at all", "Several days", "More than half the days", "Nearly every day"],
                score: [0, 1, 2, 3]
            },
            {
                id: 2,
                question: "How often have you felt down or hopeless?",
                options: ["Not at all", "Several days", "More than half the days", "Nearly every day"],
                score: [0, 1, 2, 3]
            }
        ],
        currentQuestionIndex: 0,
        userResponses: [],
        showResults: false
    }
}
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "This data structure represents a real mental health assessment. Notice how we separate data from presentation - the questions, options, and scoring are just data objects that Vue.js will render dynamically."

**[SCREEN: Add methods for handling assessment logic]**

```javascript
methods: {
    startAssessment() {
        this.currentView = 'assessment';
        this.currentQuestionIndex = 0;
        this.userResponses = [];
        this.showResults = false;
    },
    
    selectAnswer(answerIndex) {
        this.userResponses[this.currentQuestionIndex] = answerIndex;
    },
    
    nextQuestion() {
        if (this.currentQuestionIndex < this.assessmentQuestions.length - 1) {
            this.currentQuestionIndex++;
        } else {
            this.calculateResults();
        }
    },
    
    calculateResults() {
        const totalScore = this.userResponses.reduce((sum, response, index) => {
            return sum + this.assessmentQuestions[index].score[response];
        }, 0);
        
        this.assessmentScore = totalScore;
        this.showResults = true;
    }
}
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "These methods handle all the assessment logic. Notice how each function has a single responsibility - starting the assessment, handling answers, navigating questions, and calculating results. This is professional code organization."

**[SCREEN: Add template for assessment interface]**

```html
<div v-if="currentView === 'assessment' && !showResults">
    <h2>Mental Health Assessment</h2>
    <div class="progress-bar">
        Progress: {{ currentQuestionIndex + 1 }} / {{ assessmentQuestions.length }}
    </div>
    
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>{{ assessmentQuestions[currentQuestionIndex].question }}</h3>
        
        <div class="options">
            <button 
                v-for="(option, index) in assessmentQuestions[currentQuestionIndex].options"
                :key="index"
                @click="selectAnswer(index)"
                :class="{ 'selected': userResponses[currentQuestionIndex] === index }"
                class="option-button">
                {{ option }}
            </button>
        </div>
        
        <button 
            @click="nextQuestion"
            :disabled="userResponses[currentQuestionIndex] === undefined"
            class="next-button">
            {{ currentQuestionIndex === assessmentQuestions.length - 1 ? 'Get Results' : 'Next Question' }}
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
```

**NARRATOR:**
> "See how the template uses Vue.js directives like v-for to create dynamic lists, v-if for conditional rendering, and class binding for interactive styling? This creates a professional assessment interface with just a few lines of code."

    async handleLogin() {
        if (!this.validateLoginForm()) return;
        
        this.isLoading = true;
        this.errorMessage = '';
        
        try {
            // Simulate API call with realistic delay
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
            
            // In real app, this would be an actual API call
            if (this.loginForm.email === 'demo@example.com' && this.loginForm.password === 'password') {
                this.isAuthenticated = true;
                this.currentUser = { name: 'Demo User', email: this.loginForm.email };
                this.currentView = 'home';
                this.clearLoginForm();
